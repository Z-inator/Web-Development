CodeAcedemy's Full Stack Developer Course

This folder holds all the projects from the codeAcademy.com's FUll Stack Developer Course. The course is designed to take 30 weeks.
I have already compeleted the codeAcademy.com's computer science course and am using this course to build applications.
Wish me luck on the self-taught developer route!
